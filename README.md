## 👋 Hi, I'm Ufuk!

I’m a lifelong learner passionate about building products that are both functional and beautifully designed. Every day, I try to improve myself and make the world a better place. 

Writing has been part of my journey since childhood — I’ve been jotting down my thoughts for as long as I can remember. I love connecting with people by sharing my experiences.

🎬 I’m a cinephile who’s watched hundreds of movies.

🚗 An aspiring traveler who enjoys road trips across the country.

🏀 A huge basketball fan — playing or watching, I’m always in.

📚 Deeply interested in history and the stories that shaped our world.

I left my engineering studies early to pursue a full-time career in software development, and over the years, I’ve continuously expanded my skill set and explored new technologies.

I hold:

🖥️ An associate degree in Computer Programming

🎓 A bachelor’s degree in Management Information Systems

In the near future, I plan to pursue a master’s degree to further expand my skills and impact.
